This branch contains the merger of Fei's code with Rashid's and my own. I've fixed quite a few bugs in the code as well as making a few additions of my own.

The stream-config-merge.diff file contains the difference between my merger of Fei's code & Rashid's code and Fei's latest code. I have made no edits in that.

The alex-mods.diff file contains the diff of my own code (additions, bug fixes, renaming, etc) and the merged version mentioned above.

Here is a summary of my changes (by file):
   
src/freeseer/backend/gstreamer.py:
    - Added icecast_width, icecast_height and icecast_vidbitrate properties to hold the streaming resolution & bit rate
    - Added change_stream_resolution() function, which sets the resolution & assigns a bitrate based on my table
        -> If the recording resolution is known & the stream/record pair is known, assign the optimal bitrate as I've tested it to be
        -> Else, if the streaming resolution is known, assign the "average" optimal bitrate I've tested
        -> If the resolution is not known at all, just assign a default rate of 1000
    - Modified change_output_resolution() to call change_stream_resolution() to ensure that the bitrate reflects current recording resolution
    - Modified enable_icecast_streaming() to reflect these changes

src/freeseer/frontend/default/main.py:
    - modified Fei's load_settings() to include loading the streaming settings, checking if they are valid, and if so calling enable_icecast_streaming()

Deleted src/freeseer/framework/config.py, this file has been superseded by Fei's config tool.

src/freeseer/framework/core.py:
    - modified the import to be Fei's config tool vs the old config file
    - added the change_stream_resolution() function, including detecting recording resolution and calling the gstreamer.py backend version
    - replaced all instances of self.core.config with self.configTool.core.config (required for the config to work with the configtool)

src/freeseer/framework/db_connector.py:
    - modified the import to be Fei's config tool vs the old config file

src/freeseer/configtool/configtool_configloader.py:
    - modified the default streaming settings to be the same as in Rashid's code, i.e., url = 127.0.0.1, port=8000, mount=stream.ogv, pass=hackme

src/freeseer/configtool/freeseer_configtool.py:
    - fixed a typo bug, changed self.core.config.streaming to self.core.config.streaming_resolution

src/freeseer/configtool/forms/freeseer_configtool_ui.ui:
    - changed the streaming resolution options to be 320x240,480x360, 640x480 and 800x600 as I determined in my testing.


Additionally, since the Qxt fix didn't work for me, I modified src/freeseer/frontend/default/lib/config.py to add the line:
    makefile.extra_lib_dirs = ["/usr/local/Qxt/lib"]
